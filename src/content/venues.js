// Venue partners — organisations whose premises host our meetups/conferences.
// Each record is both the partner (name/logo/website) and the place
// (address/city/map). Events and conferences point here by slug
// (`venue` / `venues[]`); a venue's hosting history is derived via
// getVenueHistory() in selectors.js. For a one-off place that is NOT a
// partner, use an inline `location` on the event instead (see events.js).
//
// Fields:
//   slug, name, logo, website, description        partner info
//   address, city                                 place info
//   mapUrl?, mapEmbedUrl?, image?, logoAlt?, isSample?
